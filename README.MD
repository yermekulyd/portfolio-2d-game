# My 2D Developer Portfolio Game

Welcome to my unique 2D portfolio! Inspired by creative ways to showcase developer skills, I decided to build something different—a 2D game that represents my journey and achievements as a developer. This project is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## About This Project
This project is built using [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/), a library for making games in JavaScript. It’s a personal representation of my skills, experience, and hobbies, all encapsulated in a fun and interactive way. Each element within the game is linked to a part of my professional journey.
